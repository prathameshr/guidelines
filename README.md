Coding guidelines


1. Use indent of 2-spaces. All tabs should elaborate into 2 spaces.
2. Indentation should be maintained across entire code.
3. Every line of your code should never exceed 100 characters.
4. Variable/Rule/Method/package/Interface names should never have Large-Caps in between (no CamelCase).
    a. Eg. Integer thisVariableIsBAD - This is bad style.
5. Package names should start with a lower case only.
6. There should be only one module per package.
7. Each method should be preceded by a comment describing what the method does.
